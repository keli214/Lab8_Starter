### 1. The automated test should be in a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed, this makes sure that everyone's code is working properly together and is well-tested. 

### 2. No, because E2E testing emulates user actions rather than tests if specific function is working properly. We would use unit testing to check if a function is returning the correct output. 

### 3. No, because unit testing should be used to test single functions rather than a complicated feature that involves multiple functions. 

### 4. Yes, because max message length is a single function.
